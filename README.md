# CS440_CH04_DEMO_ROMERO_ERIC


I chose to go with GNU general public license v3.0, chose to go with this because more people can benefit from the software. It gives the end user and other programmers the complete freedom to run, share, modify and fix bugs on software which will then allow for growth of inventions and innovation, also allowing growth in the potential market. This license will for everyone to benefit everyone becauuse it gives others complete freedom to the software and allow them to use bits and pieces of code in other software, allowing for growth in mutliple areas of our lives.
